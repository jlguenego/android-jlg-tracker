    <h1>Important Notice</h1>
    <p>
      JLG Tracker needs to disable battery optimization to be sure that it is
      not interrupted for battery saving reasons.

    <p>
      JLG Tracker collects location data to enable sending location to a URL you
      can control even when the app is closed or not in use. There is absolutely
      no advertising.
